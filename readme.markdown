Mímir
=====

Mímir is a small app I made while learning the basics of backbone.js. It's a reading list, where you can put the
books you are currently interested in reading and organize then by subject. 

The backend is a little sinatra app that connects to CouchDB. My focus here was to learn Backbone.js, so the 
server side code never got much love.

Installation
------------

For now there is no installation mechanism. To run the app just unpack it somewhere, cd into the directory  
and run:

``` ruby
Rake Server

Mimir will be up at the 9393 port.
